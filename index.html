    <p>This graphic wraps up the events, interests, and works that happened around me in 2022.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I worked as a software engineer in Deno in the entire 2022.</p>

    <p>I, as a Deno engineer, mainly worked on the standard modules in 2022. I also worked on <a href="https://github.com/denoland/meet-me">meet me</a> app, <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-deno-deploy">prisma+deno integration</a>, <a href="https://deno.com/blog/introducing-fresh-wordpress-themes">wordpress+fresh integration</a>, etc.</p>

    <p>Deno had an offsite meeting on October. I met many company members in person there for the first time.</p>

    <p>I talked about npm compatibility feature of Deno in JSConf JP in November.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I created a frontend library, called <a href="https://github.com/capsidjs/capsule">capsule</a>, as a hobby. Nobody except me uses it, but I like the library very much. <a href="https://github.com/capsidjs/capsule-todomvc">The TodoMVC implementation</a> of capsule only costs 3.45KB gzipped (including the capsule runtime), which is even smaller than the 'runtime' of preact, and 10x smaller than react-dom.</p>

    <p>I got the 3rd shot of covid vaccine in March. So I believed I'd be protected to some extent from covid, but I was infected by covid in August. I was feeling bad unexpectedly long time. It lasted like ~3 months.</p>

    <p>I turned 40 in October. I'm sad to leave my 30s..</p>

    <p>I bought M1 Macbook in June, but I haven't set it up yet because old one is still working. I feel my interest to new computers was completely lost for some reason.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I went to the concert of Lady Gaga in Japan in September, and also went to the concert of Keisuke Kuwata in Tokyo in December, both together with my partner Iyo.</p>

    <p>My favorite books in this year were: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4334774660">虚ろな十字架</a> by Keigo Higashino, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4480847529">ギリシャ哲学史</a> (History of Greek Philosophy) by Noburu Notomi, and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/0521356539">Introduction to higher order categorical logic</a> by Joachim Lambek and Philip Scott.</p>

    <p>My favorite video games in this year were: Splatoon 3 and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. I'm looking forward to playing the new Zelda next year.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I got married with Iyo on July 7.</p>

    <p>My son, Rei, turned 1 on December 29. Our dog, Fuu-chan, turned 4 on the same day.</p>
